# **XiangQi Project**

## A simple game of Chinese chess

This program models a XiangQi game board for those that want to learn or play Chinese chess. I find this project 
interesting because I feel like it is a great way for me to explore how to design a program with multiple interacting 
classes. 

## User Story
- As a user, I want to play a custom game by adding multiple XiangQi pieces onto the board
- As a user, I want to be able to move pieces
- As a user, I want to be able to capture pieces
- As a user, I want to be able to play and win a classic game against a friend
- As a user, I want to try again when I made a typo and entered an invalid input
